# Architecture Diagrams

To develop the architecture diagrams for this project we used PlantUML.

## Setup

The easiest way to get started is to use the [PlantUML plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) for VS Code.

Use the PlantUML Server mode to render the diagrams. Go to the extension settings and set the following:

PlantUML Render Mode: PlantUMLServer
PlantUML Server: http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml

## Overview

The root project contains folders representing different views of the architecture.

It is recommended to start with the high level diagram and then drill down into the different views. this diagram is found in: `components/diagrams/high-level-component.puml`
